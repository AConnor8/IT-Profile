<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>Hi, I am currently an RMIT student studying the Bachelor of Information Technology through Open University Australia. This would be my first time studying a degree at a university level.</p>
<p>I am a big admirer of the English Premier League football team Chelsea FC and currently a long time Old School RuneScape player.I currently work as a Service Desk Officer for a HR Company and looking to further develop my career into my preferred area which is Networking and/or Systems Administration.</p>
<p>If I’m not at work, I am usually on my computer playing OSRS or spending the rest of my time with my partner and two kids.</p>

<h3>Why i chose IT and how it all started</h3>
<p>My interest in IT is mainly focused on Network/data management. I enjoy problem solving and being able to troubleshoot issues and get that ‘ah ha’ feeling when I find the solution/fix.  </p>
<p>I’d say my interest started at a young age; I was always playing consoles at around 8-9 yrs. old.</p>
<p>Then transitioned to playing on the PC around 13 yrs. old playing Red Alert 2: Yuri’s revenge. Ever since then, I moved on to MMORPG’s and started tinkering with my own computer.</p>
<p>After working full time as a waiter for 6 months, I spent a good month researching what I needed to build my computer and I was able to complete this by watching a lot of YouTube videos.</p>
<p>10 years later after purchasing my house with my partner, I started tinkering with my Wi-Fi to get better signal throughout the house. After that, I wanted to start tinkering with Data management where I was able to store photo’s/videos and be able to upload them onto the server/pc for storage.</p>

<h3>Why RMIT?</h3>
<p>I Chose RMIT as I heard good experience from current/former students, I also wanted the ability to be able to study at my own pace and at my own time without having to attend in-person lectures/tutorials and still work Full-Time.</p>
<p>I Expect to build a solid foundation of knowledge in all aspects of IT and to be able to branch to a specified area when able to.</p>

<h3>Ideal/Dream Job</h3>
<h4>Network Engineer</h4>
<p>The position mainly involves high level of technical support, development, documentation and management of core Network, security and systems across all Eastern Health sites.</p>
<p>The position requires extensive knowledge of Cisco core routing protocols and proven experience with Cisco wireless technologies.
3 Years in a similar position or extensive technical knowledge.</p>
<p>I currently hold 0 technical skills/experience required for the job position, but I do however have 10 years in hospitality that can translate into ‘soft skills’ where I have the ability to communicate and work well within a team and/or individually.</p>
<p>I am currently completing Angela Yu’s 100 days of programming up until the Web development part.
Then I plan to study for my CCNA to build some foundational network knowledge/skills as well as create and build a ‘home lab’ to practice.</p>

<h3>Individualised Tests</h3>
<h5>Personality Test</h5>
<h6>Type: Turbulent Adventurer</h6>
<img src="https://static.neris-assets.com/images/personality-types/avatars/isfp-adventurer-s5-male.svg" alt="Explorer" style="width:100px;height:200px;">
<p>Adventurer personalities are true artists, but not necessarily in the typical sense where they’re out painting happy little trees. Often enough though, they are perfectly capable of this. Rather, it’s that they use aesthetics, design and even their choices and actions to push the limits of social convention. Adventurers enjoy upsetting traditional expectations with experiments in beauty and behavior – chances are, they’ve expressed more than once the phrase “Don’t box me in!</p>
<h6>Role: Explorer</h6>
<p>Explorer's tend to be self-reliant and quick-thinking. These personality types don’t mind handling uncertain situations on the fly – in fact, they live for those types of situations. Explorers’ flexibility helps them to adapt to the moment, even if they don’t feel particularly prepared.</p>
<h6>Strategy: Constant Improvement</h6>
<p>Constant Improvers tend to be sensitive and introspective. They are often deep individuals who enjoy having their own space and freedom. In general, these personality types feel more comfortable on their own than mixed up in the judgment of the real world.</p>
<p>This may be because they share the two personality traits most representative of sensitivity to their environment – Introversion and Turbulence. As a result, they may find it stressful to deal with tense environments or new situations. In these moments, Constant Improvers can be deeply uncomfortable – although they may not want to let on how they really feel. In reaction, these personalities might retreat inward, react defensively, or try to escape the situation altogether. Alternatively, they might give up their own wants or needs in an effort to keep the peace.</p>
<h5>Personal Learning Profile</h5>


<h5>Learning Style</h5>
<img src="https://github.com/AConnor8/IT-Profile/blob/main/Personal%20Learning%20Profile%20Summary.pdf" alt="Learning Style">
<p>These tests help me determine my personality type, strengths, preferences and learning style.</p>
<p>For me personally, I don’t usually pay attention to these types of tests.</p>
<p>I’d say I’m more of a ‘sacrificial’ person where I’ll do what needs to be done for the team, I’m not one to push ideas or manage other people. I’m here to be a team player, provide insight and collaborate with other people.</p>

<h3>My Project</h3>
<p> My project is to develop a cloud storage/program where users are able to upload photo’s/videos from their devices onto the cloud platform for ‘First line’ of storage. </p>
<p>Next is to develop a program that continuously scans the storage space, makes copies and sends them to a dedicated NAS/Secondary storage system for better navigating/interaction.</p>
<p>The program will be able to copy and send to the second line of storage in an ‘organised’ format where users are able to edit the folders where photo’s/videos are placed for better interaction/navigating.</p>
<p>There would also be a ‘Third’ backup option in its ‘raw’ format where files/folders are directly copied from the first line of storage into the third line backup storage</p>

<p>My motivation for this project is to have a similar setup at home, where i(or my family) are able to upload files through a cloud storage platform anywhere in the world and always have a backup of it at home. As my family are massive amateur photographers who capture anything that moves, and every meal eaten.</p>

<h4>Project Features</h4>
<p>The product itself is mainly the Cloud platform/program that needs to store an abundance of high res photo/videos. The user will have an option to either save in its ‘original’ format or save in lower resolution and the ‘original’ format will be sent to the third storage/master back up system.</p>
<p>Users will be able to name/date and attach a ‘Tag’ to allow users to search specific photos that have the tagged word. The ability to assign to people/places using the ‘tag’ feature. If they want to search for a particular photo with ‘brother’ at location ‘home’ they would be able to just by adding those tagged words and using the search function.</p>
<p>Users will be able to have the assurance that their files/photos/videos will always have a secondary/master backup when uploading onto the cloud platform. They will also be able to ‘revert’ to previous back up file where needed.</p>
<p>The system will be able to continuously scan for changes to files/photos and send original copies to both the NAS and master back up. It will also be able to provide a detailed log of what changes has been to each file/s and provides an image to confirm successful upload onto the backup server.</p>
<p>Admin users or master account holders will be able to collage images into a temporary folder and send to friends/family for viewing. i.e. if an admin account user wants to provide pictures/videos of her 30th birthday, she would be able to use the search function and type ‘Admin 30th Birthday’, choose which they would like them to view and it will create a temporary folder which can be accessed through a unique link provided by the admin user. They can increase security by having it timed lock/expire, add a password, or just be able for view for anyone/everyone. They can also add the ability to restrict viewers to not be able to copy/save/download the shared files.</p>
<p>Users are not restricted by the use of using the dedicated app on their device, they can also use our website, where they can directly login and upload where needed.</p>

<h4>What do i need to succeed?</h4>
<p>Equipment needed to be able to implement, develop and create the project would be, PC NAS/PC/Home server to be able to manage/store large amounts of files these would include drives that are able to store large amount of data, we would also need equipment to house all these. I would need to also choose which OS would best fit my project idea. </p>
<p>It  would be quite tricky for me who is still only has a hair’s worth of knowledge when it comes to the IT world. Ideally, web development, if users don’t have the app installed on their preferred device, so users can upload directly on our website.</p>
<p>The ability to create, manage and maintain the software/program, so being very experiencing in programming languages. </p>
<p>Also would need the skills of a network engineer/systems admin to manage, maintain the physical nature of the platform where all data is stored.</p>
<p>It would be a very difficult task as it requires a lot of experience and knowledge in each department when creating the ideal project.</p>
<p>If the project is successful, it will determine if the main objectives are achieved.</p>
